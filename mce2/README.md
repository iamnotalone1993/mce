# MC-CChecker: A Clock-Based Approach to Detect Memory Consistency Errors in MPI One-Sided Applications
- ST-Analyzer: Reuse from MC-Checker
- Profiler: Implement by using PMPI (MPI Profiling). The vector clock algorithm is implemented here.
- DN-Analyzer: Implement the detection based vector clock algorithm
