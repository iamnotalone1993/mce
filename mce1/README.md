# MC-VCChecker: A Clock-Based Approach to Detect Memory Consistency Errors in MPI One-Sided Communication
- ST-Analyzer: Implement by text processing
- Profiler: Implement by using PMPI (MPI Profiling). The vector clock algorithm is implemented here.
- DN-Analyzer: Implement the detection based vector clock algorithm
